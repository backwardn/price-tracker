        <h1>Price Tracker is ending</h1>
        <p>Mozilla is ending official support for Firefox Price Tracker on September 30, 2019. Price Tracker will uninstall itself from Firefox in approximately 30 days. You may also choose to uninstall it now.</p>

        <p>Price Tracker began as a proof-of-concept experiment in Firefox Test Pilot, our experimental feature development program. You can learn more about Price Tracker on the <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/kb/price-tracker-retiring">support page</a>.</p>
